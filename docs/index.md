# Roblox Logger

This is the main documentation area for RDM and will contain more information than the main Github.

Roblox Logger is an easy to use logger in Roblox that allows you to see information on players, servers, and the logs of each to debug and catch hackers.

The documentation is always a work in progress. If you find any issues with the documentation or Roblox Logger, please make an issue on [Roblox Logger's issue tracker](https://github.com/froghopperjacob/Roblox-Logger/issues)!
